Hints:
1. Maybe you have more than 2 choices.
2. Check out tools like Burpsuite to modify your requests and look at the responses.

First Impressions:
1. Clicked on the "Choose Red" button, nothing happened.
2. Clicked on the "Choose Blue" button, the background's colour becomes blue.
3. After reclicking on "Choose Red", the background's colour becomes red again.
4. Nothing else changed.

Solution:
1. According to the 2nd hint, Burpsuite looks like the key to solve the challenge and according to the challenge's name, one can think of replacing the GET request to HEAD request.
2. Once the request's type is changed, the Repeater will allow us to resend the request again.
3. The flag will appear as the new reponse for the new request.
