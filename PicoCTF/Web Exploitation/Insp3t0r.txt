Hints:
1. How do you inspect web code on a browser?
2. There's 3 parts.

First Impressions:
1. As of the 1st hint, I just inspected the page

Solution:
1. Near the bottom of the page, part of the flag can be recognized: picoCTF{tru3_d3
2. As implied by the 2nd hint, the flag has 3 parts; therefore, we need 2 more parts.
3. After looking around the inspected page, I found a .css file and .js file with distinct names, mycss and myjs repectively.
4. After inspecting the .css file, the second part of the flag can be recognized: t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t
5. After inspecting the .css file, the third and final part of the flag can be recognized: _lucky?2e7b23e3}
6. Concatenate the parts together in order. 

picoCTF{tru3_d3t3ct1ve_0r_ju5t_lucky?832b0699} :)
