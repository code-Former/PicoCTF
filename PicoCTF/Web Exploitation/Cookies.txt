Hints: (None)

First Impressions:
1. Inspected the page and looked for possible 'cookies' in the Storage section and found a cookie by the name 'name' with a value of -1
2. Then I thought about changing the value of the cookie to other numbers.

Solutions:
1. After intercepting the request using Burpsuite, I created a payload of type Numbers by intrusion from 0 to 30.
2. Turned out that most of the requests had similar response sizes except for one with had a value of 18.
3. As expected, the flag was found at cookie value of 18.
